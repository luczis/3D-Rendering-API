# 3D-Rendering-API
Built from scratch, it is a rendering API developed as a challenge to myself and to understand the underlines of a GPU. It runs the graphics calculations on the CPU side, however, it utilizes OpenGL to display the rasterized buffer to the display.

# TODO

- ~~Implement texture decoder;
- ~~Implement depth checking;
- Implement Matrix and quaternions operations;
- Implement MVP matrix calculation;
- Implement .obj file reading;
- ...

# Texture support
Currently supporting only PPM, because it's simple to decode, and a base start.
